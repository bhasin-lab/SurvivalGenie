<p>Select for the tumor-infiltrating immune cell types (<b>LM6</b> or <b>LM22</b>). The relative fractions of cell types are estimated for validated LM6 and LM22 immune cell signature matrix from bulk tumors FPKM gene expression data using the [CIBERSOFT deconvolution method](https://cibersort.stanford.edu/). This option is to correlate the cell composition of tumors to molecular data profile estimated for the selected analysis type.</p> 

<p>Here for a selected cell matrix, user has an option to filter tumor samples by significant global deconvolution p-value threshold (<b>apply <0.05</b>) or not to filter and keep all samples. The default is set to <b>“Keep all”</b>.</p>
